# ImportingFinancialData

1. Import hourly or historical data from Bloomberg API or QuandL (in progress, can't access behind work firewall), into Pandas dataframe using the very nice TIA wrapper.  

2. Test a simple hypothesis.

3.  Test moves following a large move.

4.  Check price action around important events (i used korean nuclear tests)
